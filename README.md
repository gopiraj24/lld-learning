# 🏗️ LLD Learning Journey

This repo documents my **3-month Low Level Design (LLD)** learning path.  
It contains notes, UML diagrams, and code implementations of design patterns, case studies, and machine coding problems.

## 📅 Duration
March 2025 → June 2025 (12 weeks)

## 📚 Modules
1. **OOP Basics** → classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces
2. **Design Patterns** → creational, structural, behavioral
3. **Machine Coding** → real-world apps (Tic Tac Toe, Parking Lot, Splitwise)
4. **Case Studies** → Netflix, Uber, BookMyShow, etc.

## 🗂️ Structure
- `01-oop-basics/` → Concepts + examples
- `02-design-patterns/` → Patterns with UML + code
- `03-machine-coding/` → End-to-end design + code
- `04-case-studies/` → System-level designs
- `resources/` → Notes, books, and links

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Java (primary)
